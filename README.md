# Directory templates for Data Science projects

## Why?
It is important to structure your data science project based on a certain standard so that your teammates can easily maintain and modify your project.

This repository provides a template that incorporates best practices to create a maintainable and reproducible data science project.

## How are the templates organized?

The templates are organized in different branches, where each template is expected to be used along with a pre-determined set of tools. Depending on your approach (e.g., whether you want to use a cloud-based or on-premise ML project), you might want to use one template over others. In any case, the directory structure should not vary drastically.

## About this approach

The `aws-sagemaker` branch provides to you a directory structure to work with the Amazon SageMaker, an end-to-end cloud-based ML framework offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The following tools are expected to be used:

| Functionality  | Tool | Links |

## How to use this project

### Initial setup

1. Install Cookiecutter:
    ```bash
    pip install cookiecutter
    ```
1. Create a project based on the template:
    ```bash
    cookiecutter https://github.com/khuyentran1401/data-science-template --checkout aws-sagemaker
    ```
1. Push an initial commit to your newly created Data Science project
    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m 'init my data science template'
    git push origin main
    ```

### AWS SageMaker initial setup

1. Login on [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
2. Services -> Amazon SageMaker
3. On the left-side menu: Studio -> Create a SageMaker domain -> Quick setup -> setup
4. On the left-side menu: Admin configuration -> Lifecycle configurations -> Create configuration -> Paste the script on `./config/sagemaker_lifecycle.sh`
5. On the left-side menu: Admin configuration -> Domains -> Add user -> Follow the default configuration
